                <img src="images/poster2.png"> <img src="images/capture2.png" alt="[Hospital Interface]">
                <p>In last summer vacation, we have been assigned to do a project called "STEM Project". It was an individual project, we can choose any topic to be <br>our project, however, that topic need to be related to STEM; Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics. I chose "Graph Art" to be my topic. This topic relate to Mathematics,<br>it is about the image that is made by graphing. Graphing each equation make a line, every lines will be graphed to satisfy the place in order to create an image that we are trying to do.

                <p>On the last semester, I have created an engineering project with my groups. We analyzed on our school's problems as a group, narrow down problems and then<br> focus on just one topic. We have to brainstorming on these topics a lot. We have decided to make a "Message board" on a problem: Students didn't get much inforamation <br>and tend to forget it. Teachers can write homework, or annoucement on a board to notify students.

				<h3>STEM project Javascript</h3>
				<a href="04-STEM-Ichika.html" alt="[STEM project Javascript]">See the program</a><br>
				<p>Starting 2nd year in the first semester, I have written a javascript in notepad++. I have written a program to help students study Biology. It is a program that will show<br> a picture of body parts that we want to see or to know what part of body is it. Steps is very easy, just click on the droplist, choose the body part you want to see, then<br> the program will show you that body part picture.</p>

				<h3>Lipsyncing animation</h3>
				<a href="lipsync.html" alt="[lipsyncing animation]">lipsync animation</a><br>
				<p>This, lipsyncing animation, is one of my Computer skills' assignment. I spend some time to create this. I enjoy creating the cat using Adobe illustrator<br> very much, it is very cute. The hard part is the part to make a lip syncing with the illustrate. I had a hard time to set the lip to sync it with the sound. in the animation, the cat is just singing Do-Re-Mi-... and so on. Just to do that simple thing. </p>

				<h3>Engineering Animation project</h3>
				<a href="CS%20final%20animation.html" alt="[engineering animation]">Final animation</a><br>
				<p>In the end of the first semester for 2nd year, I created this animation together with my pair. This work was a pair group project. We have to create an animation<br> that show what are we doing in the Engineering Design class. At that time, it was the time we have to get some idea for our Engineering project, and for our, it is this.<br> To let the young generation know more about this Hakusan Ningyou joururi culture. It is a traditional that is risk to be gone in the future so, we are working on how to <br>keep and enhance this traditional.</p>
